Instead of sieving through all the activities on the timeline of a deal record, users can refer to the a custom field that summarizes whether the last email and call activity on the record was outbound or inbound.

The field can then be used in a report or included in a daily email send. For example, run a scheduled workflow daily that emails sales owners if the deal is not closed. The email will contain a summary of what the last email and call engagement was for that deal. They can use this to decide whether a follow-up is needed.
