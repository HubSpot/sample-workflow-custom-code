This custom coded action can be used to maintain a contact sync between two HubSpot Portals (limited to contact properties).

For example, If your business is collecting leads on a central portal (Portal A for this example) and you have different sales teams working each from their own HubSpot Portal for privacy reasons. 

You can trigger this custom coded action each time a contact is created in the central portal to create a new contact in the target Sales team portal wiht its properties.

What this code does as well, is that it assigns the correct Owner in the target portal as well.

This code can serve as inspiration for similar use cases like syncing companies, deals or tickets between multiple hubspot portals.
